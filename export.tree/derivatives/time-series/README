This data was contributed by Dr. Govinda Poudel with the following
(slightly modified) description:

fMRIData_N77.mat contains time-series data from 77 participants.
Although this contains N=77, we only used the participants with
complete (200) volumes and in sleep-deprived session. Not all 
participants had 200 volumes.

The matlab structure of the file is below:

  - fMRIData.subjects: Subject ID
  - fMRIData.ses1: Data from ses-1
  - fMRIData.ses2: Data from ses-2 

Within the fMRIData.ses, there are following variables:
  - fMRI: fMRI data for Yeo-126 atlas.
  - motion: motion parameters
  - compcorr: noise signal from principal components of joint wm+CSF mask
  - gs: global signal
  - dvars: large motion outliers
  - kss: sleepiness scale data for that subject
